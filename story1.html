                <h1>The Boundless Skyward</h1>
                <p><p>The Boundless Skyward</p>

                <p> Paul walked into the editor&rsquo;s little office on Friday hoping that he&rsquo;d get the day off that he&rsquo;d requested.<br />
                Timothy, the editor, was sitting with a peculiar expression reading a letter. <br />
                &ldquo;Hey Tim, so do I get to run free today or are you keeping me locked up?&rdquo; Paul asked, cutting to the chase, without masking the excitement in his voice.<br />
                Tim looked over his glasses at Paul and then back at the letter. &ldquo;Maybe. Come here and read this.&rdquo;</p>
                
                <p>To the Editor or whomever it may otherwise concern: </p>
                
                <p>Hello, I am a superhero in the Devontown area. I have an important announcement to make to the public, and therefore I am calling a press conference tomorrow (Friday, the 5th). The press conference will be held at 2100 34th Pl. outside the house, at noon. Any and all questions are welcome.</p>
                
                <p>-The Boundless</p>
                
                <p>&ldquo;Wow&rdquo; said Paul as he finished, &ldquo;we get all kinds of weirdos writing in huh?&rdquo;<br />
                &ldquo;Actually, my buddy down at the Times sent it over. Apparently all the major news outlets got some version of this&rdquo; Tim chuckled. <br />
                &ldquo;Some people have too much time on their hands. So anyway, about that day off&#8230;&rdquo; <br />
                Tim threw the letter on the desk towards Paul.<br />
                &ldquo;Maybe you should go and check this out&rdquo;<br />
                &ldquo;Oh come on!&rdquo; Paul groaned. &ldquo;This looks like a prank or worse, some poorly thought-out marketing scheme.&rdquo;<br />
                &ldquo;Exactly, it&rsquo;s probably nothing. Give it a quick look - and then you can have your three-day weekend.&rdquo; <br />
                &ldquo;This is going to turn out like the crazy old lady from a month ago. The one who thought a ghost found her cat&rdquo;<br />
                &ldquo;It might. Which reminds me, don&rsquo;t forget a camera. You never know when an interview with a crazy may go viral. We could use the views on our site eh?&rdquo;<br />
                Paul took the letter and sighed. He thought of the views. Ah, he&rsquo;d just get it over with. <br />
                ***<br />
                 The street was lined with rows of similar-looking houses, and some parked cars along the east sidewalk. The downtown buildings shimmered in the distance. Paul parked across the street from the address listed in the letter and got out of his car, looking around for any sign of a press conference - finding none.<br />
                Down the road he saw a lady with a smartphone, notepad, and cordless mic get out of a nearby van and approach him. <br />
                &ldquo;Are you here for the press conference?&rdquo; she asked.<br />
                &ldquo;Yep!&rdquo;<br />
                &ldquo;So am I. Devontown Happening.&rdquo; She pointed at her media badge.<br />
                &ldquo;Devontown Now&rdquo; answered Paul, holding up his own. &ldquo;So what do you think? Has this guy seen one too many of those comic book movies?&rdquo;<br />
                &ldquo;Either that or experimented with one too many drugs.&rdquo;<br />
                They chuckled and waited for several moments. Then the lady straightened up to leave.<br />
                &ldquo;Well, this was fun&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I kinda figured it was a waste of time. I&rsquo;m going for lunch.&rdquo;<br />
                The van pulled away, and Paul buttoned up his jacket. <br />
                And then he heard someone approach. <br />
                *** <br />
                 It was a fairly unassuming man, carrying some wooden materials. He was average in every manner, except perhaps for slightly messy hair, and looked to be approaching middle age. His clothes were an ordinary shirt and pants. He put down a podium, a small amplifier and plugged in a microphone. He seemed stoic at seeing that it was just Paul there. There was a pause as they both waited for anyone else to show up. When nobody did, the man said:&#8232;&ldquo;Hello, and welcome to the press conference. I am a superhero and I have an announcement: I am going to be leaving Earth.&rdquo;<br />
                There was a shuffle as Paul&rsquo;s camera turned on and rose tentatively, in search of internet gold.<br />
                &ldquo;Are you &lsquo;The Boundless&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Paul after an inviting pause. &ldquo;Where are you from? And what are your superhuman powers?&rdquo;<br />
                 &ldquo;Yes, I am &lsquo;The Boundless&rsquo;,&rdquo; answered the man, almost matter-of-factly. &ldquo;Powers, oh you know, super speed, super strength, that sort of thing. I used to have a secret identity but that&rsquo;s not very useful anymore.&rdquo;<br />
                Paul decided to play along, but could barely hide a grin. <br />
                &ldquo;And why are you leaving Earth?&rdquo;<br />
                &ldquo;Oh I am just tired!&rdquo; declared The Boundless. &ldquo;Of people!&rdquo; he added after a thought.<br />
                &ldquo;Go on&rdquo; said Paul.<br />
                 &ldquo;Y&rsquo;see I am a simple man. I have powers but really, I&rsquo;m not smart and I really don&rsquo;t understand the big problems of the world. I don&rsquo;t get all the complicated bits of stuff like economics and politics, and stuff. I suppose I like football and gardening.&rdquo;<br />
                Paul nodded, &ldquo;Sure&rdquo;<br />
                 &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve tried to help people in ways I can. I save a dog here, I stop a robbery there. I can prevent your car from crashing into a semi on the freeway, or a granny from a house fire. I suppose I just can&rsquo;t change people.&rdquo;<br />
                &ldquo;Wait, have people seen you do these amazing things?&rdquo;<br />
                &ldquo;Well no, because once I get going I move as fast as the speed of light. &lsquo;Peewww&rsquo; Besides I don&rsquo;t like a lot of attention and prefer to keep to myself. Low-key, y&rsquo;know.&rdquo; There was no story here.<br />
                &ldquo;Could you maybe do that for me right now?&rdquo; asked Paul.<br />
                Can&rsquo;t give up on those views.<br />
                &ldquo;Well, no. Y&rsquo;see that would require a lot of mental and physical focus, I&rsquo;d have to really concentrate for a minute. Besides, I&rsquo;m leaving Earth soon.&rdquo; replied the man.<br />
                &ldquo;Mhm, sure, of course&rdquo; Paul nodded. He started thinking of lunch. Besides there was also a chance he was exploiting a man with a mental condition. <br />
                The Boundless cleared his throat and carried on:<br />
                 &ldquo;Y&rsquo;know if everyone really got together and tried to change the big picture, the little problems and accidents that I help with would be all that&rsquo;s left to deal with. I can&rsquo;t help but think that maybe people feel as helpless as I do.&rdquo;<br />
                It was an oddly poignant thought, and Paul perked up. Interesting. <br />
                 &ldquo;Every day I listen to people sit and discuss things that amount to nothing! It&rsquo;s like if I sat here and argued about how many cracks there are on this pavement. I just can&rsquo;t keep up with it, every day there&rsquo;s a new sensational item or internet star. Even sports barely change from year to year.&rdquo; <br />
                Paul tried not to roll his eyes, and said &ldquo;Well you know, ordinary people like that sort of thing.&rdquo; The Boundless sensed the disdain and seemed to relent a little.<br />
                 &ldquo;Y&rsquo;know actually, I do enjoy it myself sometimes, I do. But even I know that it&rsquo;s just a cozy little escape that serves to keep the mind busy and entertained. It&rsquo;s just a reason to stop and chat with someone, without losing all hope in the future. Like a smoking break from work that never really ends.&rdquo;<br />
                &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t sound so stupid, Mr. Boundless - but why leave Earth now?&rdquo; said Paul, trying bring it back to what he considered the crux of the publicity stunt this fellow was trying to pull.<br />
                 The Boundless&rsquo; face seemed to visibly age. <br />
                 &ldquo;My wife died a little while ago. She would always tell me I could do more. Be more. But now that she&rsquo;s gone, it just feels like there is nothing left for me here.&rdquo; <br />
                 And now the man looked up into the sky, and continued in all seriousness, &ldquo;I can feel there&rsquo;s more up there. Something bigger than what happens down here. I think I&rsquo;d like to see what there might be. Wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; And he glanced at Paul.<br />
                 The bit about his wife was real, Paul could feel it. This could even be a man on the verge of a &lsquo;permanent end&rsquo;, so to speak. Paul decided to ignore that morbid possibility. His camera let out an urgent beep - low battery. It was time for lunch.<br />
                &ldquo;Well sir, I suppose I like it just fine down here. I guess that&rsquo;s all the questions I have. Would you ever return to Earth?&rdquo;<br />
                &ldquo;Maybe, maybe not. Depends on what I find.&rdquo; said the superhero.<br />
                &ldquo;Alright well, have a good day!&rdquo; Paul waved, and went back to his car. He turned off the camera. He felt a little sorry for the man at the podium.<br />
                ***<br />
                Paul got into his car. It wasn&rsquo;t entirely a waste of time, he supposed he was reasonably entertained. He looked out of his window at &lsquo;The Boundless&rsquo;. The small fellow was still at the podium, looking off into the distance. <br />
                Then the man closed his eyes. Paul looked on for a good minute as the man stood there, eyes shut&#8230; and for some reason the hair on the back of Paul&rsquo;s neck stood on end.</p>
                
                <p>The Boundless looked up at the sky - briefly at Paul - and then back up to the sky. <br />
                And then, in the blink of an eye, he took off upward and disappeared into the big blue expanse above.<br />
